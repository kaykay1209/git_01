Eager eye and willing ear,

Fit the First  
            The Landing  

"Just the place for a Snark!" the Bellman cried,  
   As he landed his crew with care;  
Supporting each man on the top of the tide  
   By a finger entwined in his hair.  

"Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice:  
   That alone should encourage the crew.  
Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice:  
   What I tell you three times is true."
